# Minecraft Nintendo DS
 A little minecraft clone on Nintendo ds

To compile this project, you need Nitro Engine, and please use my version : https://github.com/Fewnity/nitro-engine

Put all the files in C:\devkitPro\nitro-engine\examples\minecraft to compile it

This is a bad project, I don't know how to optimize my system, so I think this project is dead...

Todo :
Chunk system
Better collision system
